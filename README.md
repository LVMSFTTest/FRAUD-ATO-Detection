# FRAUD-ATO-Detection
Machine-learning ATO detection using behavioral, device, and transaction signals—built to minimize false positives and integrate with existing risk systems.

**Problem Statement:**
FinSecure is facing a surge in account takeover (ATO) attacks that bypass rules, 2FA, and manual reviews—especially via credential stuffing and social engineering. This project delivers an ML-driven detection service that fuses behavioral, device, and transaction signals to identify ATO in real time while keeping false positives low to protect customer experience. The service integrates with current risk pipelines and tooling to scale defenses and meet regulatory expectations, reducing fraud losses, operational strain, and customer dissatisfaction.

**Goals**

Detect ATO using multi-signal ML (behavioral, device, transaction).

Minimize false positives to avoid user friction.

Seamlessly integrate with existing systems and workflows.

Provide auditable signals and metrics to satisfy regulators.

**Key Features**

Feature pipeline for behavioral patterns (login velocity, session entropy), device intelligence (fingerprints, anomalies), and transaction context.

Real-time scoring API with configurable thresholds and reason codes.

Feedback loop from manual review outcomes to continually improve models.

Dashboards for precision/recall, alert volumes, and customer-impact KPIs.

Outcomes
Reduced ATO losses and operational load, improved customer trust, and stronger regulatory posture through explainable, scalable defenses.
